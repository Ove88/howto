# Howto: ARM mbed

The most configurable and useful way to export (and build) the mbed library is to use the [mbed CLI](https://docs.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os-handbook/en/5.1/dev_tools/cli/). This tool makes it very easy to export and build the mbed library for any of the supported targets. It also support several different IDE's, or just standard arm gcc make.

Requirements:

* Python
* Git
* mbed CLI: pip install mbed-cli

To get started, clone the mbed OS git repository:

git clone https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os.git
